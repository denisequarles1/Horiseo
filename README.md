## Description
The purpose and motivation for this project was to provide the Horiseon website which explains how Horiseon can enhance your Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. <br>
This is done by increasing how often a business appears to the right customers. By leveraging Horiseon, it can provide businesses control of their internet presence. 
It also focuses on marketing based on the buying habits of a company's potential customers.<br> 

 While working on this project, I learned about how businesses can utilize these services to control their internet presence and build their client base. <br>
